# Shell-Scripting-Guide
A comprehensive guide to shell scripting from beginner to advanced levels, including examples of variable types, loops, functions, and error handling. Ideal for learning and practical scripting in Unix/Linux environments.

# Array Examples

This branch contains a shell script `array.sh` that demonstrates how to use arrays in Bash from basic to advanced scenarios. The script covers a wide range of topics including:

1. Basic array creation
2. Adding elements to an array
3. Looping through arrays
4. Array length calculation
5. Associative arrays
6. Simulating multi-dimensional arrays
7. Passing arrays to functions
8. Handling special characters in arrays
9. Filtering arrays based on conditions
10. Dynamic array creation from user input
11. Error handling in arrays
12. Using arrays to store and execute commands
13. Running parallel commands with arrays
14. Using arrays with file descriptors

## How to Run

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Make the script executable:

   ```bash
   chmod +x array_examples.sh
   ```
3. Run the script

   ```bash
   ./array.sh
   ```
## Output

Each example in the script prints its output to the console. Follow the prompts for interactive sections like entering numbers for dynamic arrays.

## Prerequisites

- Bash 4.0 or higher (for associative arrays).
- Ensure you have internet access to test parallel execution of URLs in example 13.
