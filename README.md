# Decision Making with `if` Statements in Bash

This repository contains a script that demonstrates decision-making in bash using `if` statements. The script includes various types of condition checks, ranging from basic `if` statements to complex scenarios involving string comparisons, file tests, arithmetic comparisons, compound conditions, and functions.

## File Structure

- **decision_making_with_if.sh**: This is the main script file that demonstrates how to perform decisions in bash with several different tests.

## Features

- **Basic `if` Statements**: Simple conditions using numbers and strings.
- **if-else Statements**: Handling alternate conditions.
- **if-elif-else Statements**: Checking multiple conditions.
- **String Comparisons**: Compare and evaluate string values.
- **File Tests**: Check properties of files such as existence, type, and permissions.
- **Arithmetic Comparisons**: Numeric comparisons using operators such as `-eq`, `-gt`, and `-lt`.
- **Compound Conditions**: Combining conditions with AND (`&&`) and OR (`||`).
- **Nested if Statements**: Using `if` within another `if` to evaluate multiple conditions.
- **Regular Expressions**: Matching string patterns using regex.
- **Functions with if Statements**: Demonstrating how to use functions for decision making.

## How to Use

1. Make the script executable:

  ```bash
  chmod +x decision_making_with_if.sh
  ```

2. Run the script:

  ```bash
  ./decision_making_with_if.sh
  ```

## Example Output

The script will display various messages based on the conditions defined in each test. For example, it will check for string equality, file properties, and evaluate mathematical conditions.
